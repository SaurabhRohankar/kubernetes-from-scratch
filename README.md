# kubernetes-from-scratch

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Kubernetes From Scratch" project! This repository contains step-by-step guides and configuration to build a kubernetes cluster from the ground up. By following these guides, you'll gain a deep understanding of how Kubernetes components work together.


## Components

We'll be building and configuring the following kubernetes components:

1. [Kubelet](./components/01-kubelet/kubelet.md)
2. kube-apiserver (coming soon)

Each component has it's own directory with a detailed README and necessary configuration files.


## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have:

- Basic understanding of kubernetes concept
- A linux environment (this guide uses Arch Linux)
- Root or sudo access
